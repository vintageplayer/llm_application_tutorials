-# LastWish Plugin
-LastWish is a secure plugin designed for unexpected situations (such as accidents) where the original owner is unable to perform actions on a Safe (a digital wallet with assets), either due to accidental death or incapacity. This plugin allows for the transfer of Safe ownership to a designated address, preventing the assets within the Safe from being permanently locked.
+## Foundry
 
-## Problem to solve
-In the unfortunate event of the Safe owner's unexpected demise, LastWish enables the safe transfer of assets from the Safe to a designated inheritor, preventing the permanent lockup of assets within the Safe. Despite the constant pursuit of profit and exploration in the realm of cryptocurrency, the occurrence of accidents is often overlooked. These accidents can lead to the irreversible locking of assets within the Safe. This not only results in the permanent loss of the owner but also deprives their loved ones of the fruits of their labor. The LastWish Plugin aims to address this concern by providing a straightforward solution: even in the face of unexpected events, we can ensure that the assets we've worked hard to accumulate are passed on to our cherished ones. Moreover, LastWish facilitates this process without requiring the sharing of existing permissions with the inheritor, mitigating concerns about the inheritor absconding with the Safe's assetsâ€”addressing a real-world issue that is not uncommon.
+**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**
 
+Foundry consists of:
 
-## Features
-- User-friendly and easy to comprehend
-- Directly compatible with existing Safes, requiring no additional setup
-- Supports both the original Safe Module architecture([LastWishModule.sol](./src/LastWishModule.sol)) and the new Safe Plugin architecture([LastWishPlugin.sol](./src/LastWishPlugin.sol))
+-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
+-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
+-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
+-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
 
-## How to Use
-1. The Safe owner can designate an inheritor and set a lockout period within the LastWish configuration.
+## Documentation
 
-2. In the unfortunate event that the Gnosis owner is unable to perform Safe operations due to unforeseen circumstances, the designated inheritor can initiate a transfer request for the Safe, which then enters a locked state for a specified duration.
-
-3. Once the lockout period has elapsed, the inheritor can proceed to claim ownership of the Safe and gain the authority to operate it.
-
-4. In cases where the inheritor's intentions are malicious, the Safe owner retains the ability to reject the transfer request during the lockout period.
-Simultaneously, the inheritor's access rights will be revoked. It is advisable to employ [Forta](https://forta.org/) to monitor whether any inheritance requests have been initiated by the inheritor.

<h3>Comment</h3>
<pre>Overall, the changes made in this diff seem to be focused on updating the README.md file for the project. Here are some suggestions for improvements and refactors based on best practices:

1. **Title and Description**: The title and description of the change could be more descriptive and provide a clear summary of the changes made. For example, instead of just "Foundry", the title could be "Update README.md with Foundry Overview and Usage Instructions".

2. **Clarity and Organization**: The README.md file could benefit from clearer headings and organization. Consider breaking down the content into sections with subheadings to make it easier to navigate and understand. For example, separate the "Foundry" section into subsections for each component (Forge, Cast, Anvil, Chisel) and provide a brief description for each.

3. **Formatting**: Ensure consistent formatting throughout the file. For example, use consistent indentation and spacing for code blocks and commands. Consider using a consistent code style guide (e.g., Rustfmt) to automatically format code snippets.

4. **Documentation Link**: Instead of just mentioning the documentation in the text, consider making it a clickable link. For example, use [Foundry Documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to make it easier for readers to access the documentation.

5. **Code Examples**: Consider adding some code examples or snippets to demonstrate the usage of different components of Foundry. This can help users understand how to use the toolkit effectively.

6. **License**: Include a license section at the end of the README.md file to clarify the licensing terms for the project. For example, add a section like "License" and provide a link to the actual license file (e.g., MIT license).

These suggestions aim to improve the clarity, organization, and usability of the README.md file for the project. Remember to consider the specific context and requirements of the project when implementing these suggestions.</pre>
