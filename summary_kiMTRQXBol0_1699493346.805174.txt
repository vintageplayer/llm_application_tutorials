In this podcast, Megan Callie and Jake Draymond discuss how media outlets tend to take ideas from independent podcasters but not cite them, as well as how journalists are mostly activists pushing a specific political agenda. They also talk about the Gelman Amnesia effect, where journalists get too lazy to fact-check their stories, and how headlines are often changed to make stories more clickable. Finally, they discuss how a New Republic article had a terrible illustration of one of the podcasters, but it didn't really matter since most people just read the headline.

David Sacks has been seen as a prophet of urban doom due to his observations about San Francisco's streets. This has led to a debate about the lack of empathy for small business owners who are struggling to stay afloat due to the homeless population. It is argued that if more focus was put on treating addiction and mental illness, rather than just providing housing, the problem could be solved. The power of language is also discussed, with the suggestion that if people were referred to as 'untreated persons' rather than 'homeless persons', it could lead to a shift in policy.

Chris and Jake discuss the current housing crisis in the US due to the defunding of mental health infrastructure by President Reagan in the 1980s and the lack of government action to address it. They also discuss how politicians have failed to act on homelessness in the last 10-15 years, as well as the power of drugs and how they have contributed to the crisis. Lastly, they criticize the current policy of using taxpayer money to build housing on expensive land, instead of building large scale shelters with treatment services.

Microsoft is close to investing 10 million in Open AI, a company that is using AI to create content and answer queries. VCs are hoping this will be the next wave, but it's still uncertain if startups will be able to benefit from the technology. Open AI was originally started as a non-profit with the goal of advancing digital intelligence for the benefit of humanity, but has since become a for-profit company. It is unclear what the implications of this convoluted transaction will be.

A group of investors including Sam Greg, Elon Reed, Jessica Peter Thiel, AWS, and YC have committed to donating over a billion dollars to support Open AI. This is a stark contrast to seven years ago when the project first started and has evolved into a commercial alignment. Google has open sourced many tensorflow predictive models and tool kits, while Open AI has become a profitable enterprise model. The biggest question about AI is who owns the models and what are they legally allowed to do with them. Facebook's Pytorch and Google's TPU have become mainstream and captured people's imagination. There are questions about whether Yelp can make a legal claim against chat GPT for using their data without permission or linking to it.

Chat GPT and other services must use citations and links to the original work they use, and get permission if necessary. This could lead to lawsuits, especially if Section 230 is rewritten. AI systems are now synthesizing data and creating new models, which could change all computing tools. This could have a big impact on the legal field, as GPT could be used to summarize legal precedents quickly and accurately.

In this special podcast mini-series, Reed will be having conversations with chat GPT, a text-to-speech platform powered by AI. They discuss the potential of open AI capabilities becoming commoditized, with the real advantage coming from applications that have access to proprietary data sets. They also discuss the idea of a "conductor economy" where people are skilled at manipulating software to drive intentional outcomes and how it could catalyze a shift in the workforce. Finally, they consider how AI could be used to create content such as novels, symphonies, and movies, as well as video games that people can "live in".

This discussion explores the implications of the recent incidents of classified documents being found in the homes of the last three presidential candidates: Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton. It is suggested that these incidents are a result of over-classification, which is a response to the Freedom of Information Act. It is argued that most documents should be declassified after five years, unless they are of extreme sensitivity such as schematics for nuclear weapons. The discussion also touches on potential conflicts of interest and the idea that these incidents may have been setup in order to create a false equivalency between Biden and Trump for the 2024 election.

The All In podcast discuss the potential of someone taking a cabinet position, the implications of the SPF trial, and a movie recommendation. They also discuss the implications of the rich/poor divide and how it is reflected in the world, as well as the implications of becoming an ambassador. They also discuss the impact of Independent Media and the use of words such as 'genuflecting'.
